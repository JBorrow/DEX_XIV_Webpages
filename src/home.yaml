  blurb: >
      Come along to the Department of Physics on the 31st of October
      (<a href="http://www.darkmatterday.com/">Dark Matter Day!</a>) for a
      chance to engage with some of the exciting science that we do. We will
      have interactive exhibits where you will learn about Dark Matter, what
      it is, what effects it causes and how we are trying to detect it right
      here in the North East!</p>

      <p>The event will be at the new Physics building (picture right) and
      will start at 6:00 PM. We look forward to seeing you there!</p>
